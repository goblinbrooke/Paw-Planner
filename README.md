# Paw-Planner
Super cool pet app! 
Developed by: Mariah Rosman and Brooke Vlahos

Paw Planner allows you to manage and keep track of all your pets! After registering yourself with a valid email address, you can create profiles for your pets including any relevant dietary and vet info. 

Further development of the app will include a map where you can add yourself as a pet sitter and an area for vet notes to be added for specific pets.
